Hello, I'm Angel Alvarado.

I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science from the Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo Leon in Nuevo Leon, Mexico.

I like making stuff that can benefit myself and those around me.

My goal is to be proficient in various technologies so that I have a stable income and a stress free life in the future.

To achieve this I've started doing the full stack developer course from theodinproject.com, I believe this can help me boost up my knowledge
and give me a better chance on the professional world.

Please forgive any typos as English is not my first language and I could commit some grammar errors here and there.

Thank you for checking out this section of my GitHub, hopefully you found something useful.
